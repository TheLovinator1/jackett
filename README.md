## Running Jackett behind a reverse proxy

Reverse Proxy instructions are from
the [Jackett/Jackett README.md](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett#running-jackett-behind-a-reverse-proxy):

When running Jackett behind a reverse proxy make sure that the original hostname of the request is passed to Jackett. If
HTTPS is used also set the X-Forwarded-Proto header to "https". Don't forget to adjust the "Base path override" Jackett
option accordingly.

Example config for apache:

```apacheconf
<Location /jackett>
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME}
    ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:9117
    ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:9117
</Location>
```

Example config for Nginx:

```apacheconf
location /jackett {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9117;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $http_host;
    proxy_redirect off;
}
```
